## LABORATORY EXERCISE #4 ##
Your task is to edit the CSS file and design the different web pages (delete/edit the existing dummy/test code).
1. Fork this repository and add your groupname when forking the repository.
2. Edit the Lab4.css file. You are NOT allowed to modify/change the HTML files.
3. Before your defense, push your final edited Lab4.css file to your group's forked repository.

Note: More details on how to fork a repo in the Lab 4B Activity guide.

Tips: 
1. There are some elements that have no classes at all (such as the list of steps in making coffee), to style them, 
you can use contextual selectors or attribute selectors to select them for styling
2. Just with any web design project, it's best to draft a wireframe first before you start working with the CSS.
3. You do not have to select all the classes/ids in the web pages; 
the main goal is to create a website that is both visually appealing and user-friendly.
